                        <p>
                            Raccoons in your attic, crawlspace, or walls can cause major damage: tearing insulation, chewing wires, contaminating areas with feces, and making loud noises at night. 
                            I provide humane, effective raccoon removal and exclusion services customized to your home and situation.
                            If it’s baby season, I inspect for kits and apply exclusion fluid — a natural deterrent that triggers the mother to relocate her young on her own, without the need for forceful removal. 
                            I also install one-way doors that allow raccoons to exit but prevent them from getting back in. When necessary, I use safe, humane trapping as part of the process.
                            Every job is tailored to your unique structure and the behavior of the animals involved. 
                            Once the raccoons are out, I seal up all active and potential entry points to keep them from coming back. Cleanup and minor damage repair services are available as well.
                            With over 8 years of hands-on wildlife experience, I’ve dealt with everything from single raccoons in chimneys to full attic infestations.<br><br>

                            Call Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest for expert raccoon removal and lasting protection.

                        <h2>Bird Removal & Exclusion Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            Birds nesting in or around your home can lead to serious health risks, property damage, and persistent noise issues. 
                            Whether they’re in your attic, soffits, vents, or wall voids, birds leave behind droppings, nesting material, and parasites that contaminate air and damage structures. 
                            I offer safe, humane bird removal and exclusion services designed to fully eliminate the problem and stop it from coming back.
                            A major focus of my bird work involves solar panel cleanouts, where pigeons and other birds often build dense nests underneath the panels. 
                            Over time, these areas fill with droppings, feathers, and waste. Bird pheromones left behind can continue to attract more birds, growing the infestation. 
                            In many cases, gutters become completely clogged, making them ineffective and leading to water damage, overflow, and staining near siding and entryways.<br><br>

                            I provide full solar panel bird services including:<br>
                            • Removal of all birds and nesting materials from under and around panels<br>
                            • Elimination of pheromone traces to stop re-attraction<br>
                            • Roof, gutter, and ground-level cleanup of droppings and debris<br>
                            • Gutter clearing and sanitation to restore proper water drainage<br>
                            • Full sealing of solar panel edges to prevent access<br>
                            • Installation of bird deterrents to make rooftops less appealing<br><br>

                            In addition to rooftop bird work, I also:<br>
                            • Humanely remove birds from attics, soffits, vents, and walls<br>
                            • Remove hazardous nests located in areas that threaten human health<br>
                            • Replace soft ventilation passages (such as flex ducting and dryer vent hoses) that have been packed with nesting materials, restoring safe and proper airflow<br>
                            • Offer complete cleanup, sanitation, and exclusion to keep birds out for good<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of experience handling both nuisance birds and protected species, I do the job right—clean, legal, and built to last.<br><br>

                            Call Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest to schedule a full bird and solar panel inspection today.

                        <p>
                            Squirrels are fast, destructive, and relentless once they get inside your attic, roofline, or walls. 
                            They chew through wood, insulation, and even electrical wiring, creating serious fire hazards and expensive damage. 
                            I offer humane, effective squirrel removal and exclusion services customized to your specific home and situation.
                            Every job starts with a full inspection to locate all entry points and assess damage. 
                            I then design a removal plan tailored to your structure, using proven methods like exclusion fluid, which naturally motivates the mother to relocate her babies on her own. 
                            I also install one-way door systems that allow squirrels to exit but not return, and use safe, humane trapping when necessary.
                            Once the squirrels are out, I seal all entry points to prevent future access and restore your space if needed.<br><br>

                            In addition to removal, I offer:<br>
                            • Safe and humane trapping for all squirrel species found in Utah<br>
                            • Prevention services to stop squirrels from trying to access your home in the first place<br>
                            • Full deterrent solutions to make your property less appealing and less accessible to squirrels<br>
                            • Complete cleanup and sanitation services to remove nesting material, feces, urine, and scent trails<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of hands-on wildlife experience, I provide long-term solutions that work, not just temporary fixes.<br><br>

                            Call Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest to schedule your inspection and protect your home from squirrel damage.

                        <p>
                            Bats play an important role in our ecosystem, but when they move into your attic, eaves, or walls, they can create serious problems. 
                            Bat guano (droppings) can damage insulation, contaminate air quality, and lead to health risks like histoplasmosis. 
                            I provide safe, legal, and humane bat removal and exclusion services that respect both your home and protected wildlife laws.
                            All of my work is fully compliant with Utah state regulations and federal protections for bat species. 
                            I know when and how to appropriately and legally exclude bats, including avoiding maternity seasons when young bats are unable to fly. 
                            Every job begins with a thorough inspection to identify active roosts, entry points, and signs of damage or contamination.
                            Using approved one-way exclusion systems, I allow bats to safely exit the structure without the ability to return. 
                            No harmful chemicals, traps, or poisons are ever used. Once the bats have fully vacated, I seal all active and potential entry points to prevent re-entry.<br><br>

                            Additional services include:<br>
                            • Targeted bat removals for any individual bats inside the living space<br>
                            • Bat-proofing and exclusion work designed to make your property less desirable for future roosting<br>
                            • Cleanup and sanitation of guano and urine to remove health hazards and odor<br>
                            • Property assessments to identify and correct conditions that attract bats<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of hands-on experience handling protected species, I bring the knowledge, care, and legal understanding needed to get the job done right.<br><br>

                            Call Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest to schedule a bat inspection and protect your home the right way.

                        <p>
                            Snakes on your property can be a serious concern — especially when they’re found near homes, garages, patios, or inside crawlspaces. 
                            Whether non-venomous or venomous, I provide fast, safe, and professional snake removal services backed by years of hands-on field experience.
                            I handle both non-venomous and venomous snake removal, using safe, legal, and humane techniques. 
                            All removals are performed with care to protect people, pets, and the animals themselves. 
                            If you see a snake and aren’t sure what kind it is, do not try to handle it — call and I’ll come inspect and remove it safely.<br><br>

                            After removal, I offer a full range of snake deterrent and prevention services to reduce the chance of future encounters, including:<br>
                            • Habitat modification to make your property less attractive to snakes<br>
                            • Removal or reduction of food sources (like rodents or nesting birds)<br>
                            • Physical barriers, sealing of entry points, and exclusion work for garages, crawlspaces, and foundations<br>
                            • Application of natural or chemical snake deterrents as needed<br>
                            • Landscape evaluations to help reduce snake shelter zones (wood piles, overgrown vegetation, debris, etc.)<br><br>

                            Snakes often end up near or inside homes when they’re seeking food, shelter, or cooler shaded areas. 
                            I take a full-property approach to help eliminate those conditions and give you peace of mind.<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of wildlife control experience in Utah, I’m trained and prepared to safely deal with everything from garter snakes to rattlesnakes.<br><br>

                            Skunks can cause serious problems when they settle under homes, decks, sheds, or crawlspaces. 
                            Their digging can damage structures, and their spray leaves behind strong, long-lasting odors. 
                            I offer professional skunk removal and exclusion services tailored to each situation for safe, effective, and lasting results.
                            Every job starts with a full inspection to locate burrows, access points, and signs of activity. 
                            Based on your property and the behavior of the animal, I’ll build a custom plan that may include exclusion fluid, one-way door systems, or safe and humane trapping when necessary.
                            Once the skunks are out, I seal all entry points and reinforce vulnerable areas to prevent future digging or re-entry.<br><br>

                            Additional skunk services include:<br>
                            • Odor control and deodorizing treatments for crawlspaces, foundation walls, and spray zones<br>

                        <p>
                            Termites can silently destroy the structure of a home from the inside out, often causing thousands in damage before they’re even noticed. 
                            I offer complete termite services — from active infestation treatment to long-term prevention and certified inspections — to keep your home protected.
                            If termites are already present, I apply targeted liquid treatment solutions to eliminate the active colony and stop further damage. 
                            For long-term protection, I offer both liquid barrier systems and bait station installations, tailored to your property and risk level. 
                            These preventative options help defend your home year-round and catch termite activity before it becomes a serious problem.
                            I also provide termite inspections for real estate transactions, including WDI (wood-destroying insect) reports for financing, refinancing, or selling a home. 
                            These inspections meet the standards required by lenders and help ensure a smooth closing process.<br><br>

                            Additional termite services include:<br>

                            • Expert identification of termite signs and risk areas on your property<br>
                            • Honest recommendations with no upselling — just what your home actually needs<br><br>

                            Gophers may be small, but the damage they cause can add up fast. 
                            A single gopher can dig hundreds of feet of tunnels in just a few days — tearing up lawns, killing plants, damaging irrigation systems, and weakening the soil under patios, sidewalks, and driveways. 
                            If left untreated, gophers can quickly take over a yard and spread to neighboring properties.
                            I provide complete gopher control services using safe, targeted baiting techniques that effectively eliminate active infestations. 
                            My baiting method not only removes the current problem but also acts as a preventative and scare tactic, helping deter new gophers from moving into the area after treatment.
                            Each job is custom-tailored to your property and the level of activity, ensuring fast results with minimal disruption.<br><br>

                            Gopher services include:<br>
                            • Professional-grade baiting to fully eradicate active gophers<br>
                            • Prevention and deterrence through ongoing bait zones and strategic placement<br>
                            • Yard evaluations to identify tunnel networks and problem areas<br>
                            • Follow-up service options for heavy infestations or long-term prevention<br>
                            • Honest, no-pressure service from a licensed professional<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of hands-on experience in wildlife and pest control, I know how to stop gophers fast and protect your property long term.<br><br>

                        <h2>Mice Control, Exclusion & Sanitation Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            Mice are more than just a nuisance — they’re a serious threat to your home and health. 
                            As temperatures drop, rodents like house mice and field mice seek warmth and shelter indoors, often slipping in through gaps and cracks you might not even notice. 
                            Once inside, they chew wires, destroy insulation, and contaminate your living space with droppings and urine that carry harmful bacteria.
                            I provide full-service mouse control for both interior and exterior infestations. 
                            Whether you’re hearing noises in the attic or spotting droppings in the kitchen, I offer a custom-tailored plan designed for fast elimination and long-term prevention.<br><br>

                            My services include:<br>
                            • Detailed inspections of the entire structure — locating all active entry points, nesting areas, and rodent travel paths others often overlook<br>
                            • Aggressive baiting strategies using professional-grade bait in tamper-resistant stations for fast knockdown and long-term exterior control<br>
                            • Safe, humane trapping in areas where baiting isn’t preferred or where activity is localized<br>
                            • Full exclusion and seal-up work, using galvanized steel mesh, chew-proof caulk, chew-resistant foam, concrete patches, and other durable materials — all designed to permanently seal rodents out<br>
                            • Complete rodent clear-outs, including attic and crawl space removal, disposal, and follow-up<br>
                            • Sanitation and cleanup services for droppings, nesting debris, urine, and damaged insulation — restoring your home to a clean and healthy state<br><br>

                            Whether it's mice in the attic, crawlspace, walls, or garage, I’ve got the tools, experience, and techniques to get the job done right — and keep them from coming back.<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of experience in professional rodent and wildlife control, I know how to stop infestations at the source and protect your property long term.<br><br>

                        <h2>Rat Control, Exclusion & Sanitation Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            Rats are destructive pests that can seriously impact your home and health. 
                            They chew through wires, insulation, and structural materials, and their urine and droppings contaminate surfaces and spread harmful bacteria. 
                            Rats are active year-round — not just in winter — and often establish themselves under concrete slabs, sheds, decks, crawlspaces, and other hidden areas, creating dangerous structural and sanitation issues if left unchecked.
                            I provide complete rat control services for both residential and commercial properties — combining aggressive removal with long-term prevention.<br><br>

                            Services include:<br>
                            • Detailed inspections of the entire structure and property — identifying all active and potential entry points, nesting zones, and travel routes<br>
                            • Professional baiting programs with tamper-resistant stations, strategically placed to knock down rat populations fast — especially along exterior foundations and fences<br>
                            • Safe and effective trapping for indoor or bait-sensitive areas — tailored to the structure and activity<br>
                            • Full exclusion and seal-up work, using galvanized steel mesh, chew-proof caulk, chew-resistant foam, and durable metal and concrete barriers to permanently block access<br>
                            • Attic, wall, shed, and crawl space clear-outs, including rat removal and full cleanup<br>
                            • Sanitation services, removing droppings, urine-soaked insulation, and nesting debris to restore healthy conditions and eliminate the scent trails that attract more rodents<br><br>

                            Whether they’re in your attic, tunneling under your shed, or showing signs around your foundation, I design a customized removal and prevention plan to solve the problem completely and protect your property long term.<br><br>

                            With over 8 years of professional rodent and wildlife control experience, I use the best tools, methods, and materials to keep rats out for good.<br><br>

                            Using an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, every situation is treated with a customized strategy to eliminate the infestation and keep pests from coming back — not just quick sprays and surface-level fixes.<br><br>

                            • Seasonal exterior treatments to block seasonal pest migration<br>
                            • Insect entry-point sealing available as an add-on — includes crack/gap sealing, screening, and use of chew-resistant materials like caulk and foam<br><br>
                            
                            Sealing is available as an additional service and is highly recommended in areas where repeat activity is likely. I’ll show you where pests are getting in and offer long-lasting protection options.
                            To make things even easier, I offer no-contact sign-ups for recurring pest control services — hassle-free and convenient.

                        <h2>Vole Control & Prevention Services</h2>
                        <p>
                            Voles may be small, but they can cause major damage to your yard and landscaping in a short amount of time. 
                            These burrowing rodents tunnel just beneath the surface, destroying grass roots, garden beds, and young trees while leaving unsightly surface runways across your lawn. 
                            If left unchecked, a vole infestation can spread rapidly and become extremely difficult to control.
                            I offer proven vole control using targeted and safe baiting techniques that fully eliminate active colonies while creating a built-in prevention and deterrent effect for future vole activity.<br><br>

                            Services include:<br>
                            • Expert property inspection to locate active tunnels, runways, and nest zones<br>
                            • Subsurface bait placements — safe, efficient, and specifically targeted to vole movement patterns<br>
                            • Long-term protection built into the treatment process to discourage re-infestation<br>
                            • Honest assessment and follow-up options based on your property’s layout and activity level<br><br>

                            Voles are active year-round and can cause damage in every season — especially during fall and winter when vegetation is limited. The earlier they’re treated, the easier they are to eliminate.<br><br>
                            
                            If you’re seeing trails in your lawn or damage to your garden, don’t wait — call Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest today for fast and effective vole removal.

                            A dead animal in or around your home isn’t just unpleasant — it’s a serious health hazard. Whether it’s in a wall, under the home, in the attic, or out on the property, Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest provides prompt and professional dead animal removal services.
                            I locate, remove, and properly dispose of the carcass, while also addressing the contamination and odor left behind.
