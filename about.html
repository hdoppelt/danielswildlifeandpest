                    <h2>About Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest</h2>

                    <p>
                    I don’t just set traps and move on — I build strategic, customized plans to fully remove wildlife and pests from your property and make sure they stay out. With over 8 years of experience throughout the Salt Lake Valley, I’ve personally handled thousands of jobs, and I bring that same level of care, precision, and problem-solving to every single one.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve helped build large pest and wildlife companies from the ground up — giving them the systems, structure, and reputation they needed to grow. But as they expanded, I saw their quality slip. Services became rushed, problems were patched instead of solved, and customers were left with the bare minimum. That’s why I started Daniel’s Wildlife & Pest — so I could deliver the kind of work I believe people deserve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    When you work with me, you’re getting that same high-level expertise and professionalism — every time. I’m the owner and the technician, so I personally handle every job from start to finish. No shortcuts. No guesswork. Just clean, effective results.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I love what I do, and it shows in the results. Whether it’s a small insect issue or a major attic infestation, I bring the same energy, detail, and care to every job. If you're tired of half-done service or call center techs just checking boxes, let me show you what real pest and wildlife control looks like.
